## ArkOS Theme 🎨

Hi! This is my first **ArkOS theme**, and it’s called **Klon** for three reasons:

1. **It started as a clone** (or remix) of two themes I really like: [Base-Text](https://github.com/Jetup13/es-theme-base-text) and [MinuARK](https://github.com/Vidnez/es-theme-MinUArk). But after a while, it kinda took on a life of its own.
2. **I’m using an R36S clone** (which, of course, I bought without realizing it was a clone). It’s actually the only handheld of its kind I own.
3. **It’s a little guitar-related easter egg** —“Klon” is the name of a legendary guitar pedal that I’ll probably never be able to afford.

## Notes ✏️
* Very minimalist and text-focused.
* Still a work in progress! Feedback welcome.
