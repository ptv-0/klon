## ArkOS Theme üé®

Hi! This is my first **ArkOS theme**, and it‚Äôs called **Klon** for three reasons:

1. **It started as a clone** (or remix) of two themes I really like: [Base-Text](https://github.com/Jetup13/es-theme-base-text) and [MinuARK](https://github.com/Vidnez/es-theme-MinUArk). But after a while, it kinda took on a life of its own.
2. **I‚Äôm using an R36S clone** (which, of course, I bought without realizing it was a clone). It‚Äôs actually the only handheld of its kind I own, running [ArkOS for K36 by AeolusUX](https://github.com/AeolusUX/ArkOS-K36).
3. **It‚Äôs a nod to one of my other hobbies, playing guitar** ‚Äî ‚ÄúKlon‚Äù is the name of a [legendary guitar pedal](https://reverb.com/brand/klon) that I‚Äôll probably never be able to afford.

It's also...
* Very minimalist and text-focused.
* Still a work in progress! Feedback welcome, especially if you have other 640x480 / 4:3 devices. It probably won‚Äôt work very well on other aspect ratios for now üòÖ
